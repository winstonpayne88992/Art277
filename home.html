            <h2>What is Lemme Help?</h2>
            <p id="p1" style="font-size: larger;">
                Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19:
                senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which
                put them at additional risk. <br>
                Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary
                supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be. <br><br>

                How we help
                Helping Hands Community connects those who must shelter in place with our
                volunteers and delivery partners so groceries, medication and essential
                supplies get delivered safely. Our technology platform makes community
                volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive solution for
                partners to scale their own impact.
                Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch requests
                at scale through the Helping Hands Community platform, while we connect
                individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.
